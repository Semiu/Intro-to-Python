### For Python and everything Pythonic!

My Python works which are yet to evolve to a full scale standalone project, or pieces of coding experimentation (or playground, as I prefer to call it), are kept in this repo. 

Therefore, kindly proceed with caution!

`Basics` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining basic Python workings, such as string operations, among others.

`analysis-dashboard` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining visualization and dashboard development using Python, and libraries such as Dask.

`aws-data-engineering` folder contains scripts and notebooks demonstrating data engineering tasks generally and specifically using AWS cloud environment.

`data-structure` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining data structure, algorithms and design patterns in Python.

`deep-learning` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining deep learning using varying frameworks such as Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch.

`Django` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the working of the Django framework for building Python MVT applications.

`flask` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the working of the Flask framework for building Python web applications.

`machine-learning` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining basic machine learning concepts and theories or demonstrating their applications.

`metaheuristics` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining evolutionary computations such as genetic and evolutionary strategies.
