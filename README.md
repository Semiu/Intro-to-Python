### For Python and everything Pythonic!

My Python works which are yet to evolve to a full scale standalone project, or pieces of coding experimentation (or playground, as I prefer to call it), are kept in this repo. 

Therefore, kindly proceed with caution!

`Basics` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining basic Python workings, such as its primitive data operations, and also basic coding challenges.

`data-structure` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining data structure, algorithms and design patterns in Python.

`Django` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the working of the Django framework for building Python MVT applications.

`flask` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the working of the Flask framework for building Python web applications.

`discrete-maths` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the fundamental discrete mathematics for Computer Science generally, and Data Structure and Algorithm specifically.

`OOP` folder contains scripts and notebooks explaining the Python Object-oriented programming.
