Two folders in the `Basics` are `Applications` and `Computations`.

`Computations` contains scripts on trivial mathematical computation using Python, for example, a Python script to calculate factorial of a number.

`Applications` are simple Python applications/games. Number guessing, stock price prediction are examples.
