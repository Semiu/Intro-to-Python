Subfolders in the `Basics` are roughly categorised to `Applications`, `basic-computations` and `problem-solving`.

The scripts in `Applications` are demonstrations of trivial Python applications. Number guessing, stock price prediction, weather, and GUI.

The `basic-computations` contains a script on collection of exercises on basic Python operations, trivial mathematical computation using Python, for example, a Python script to calculate factorial of a number.

The `problem-solving` contains self-illustrating Jupyter notebooks on different coding challenges.
